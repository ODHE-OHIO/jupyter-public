    "This (roughly) linear distribution means that when you pick a number, it has an equal likelihood of being any other number in the range 0 to $2^{256}$.  The Bitcoin proof-of-work process has an adjustable difficulty based on the current amount of mining, so a Bitcoin miner's job is to find a number called, in this context, a _nonce_ to add to A to get a resulting B less than the difficulty value.  We will set our difficulty value at $2^{253}$; the smaller the difficulty value, the harder it is to find a find a valid nonce, so this value is quite easy.  Try out a few numbers by changing the value of X and see if you can find one that hashes to less than $2^{253}$!"
