    "# The One Time Pad cipher\n",
    "_Recap: A cipher is a technique that can encrypt or decrypt data (which is commonly referred to as \"plaintext\" or \"cleartext\"). During encryption, the input plaintext is converted into what is known as the \"ciphertext\". It is impossible to read or extract any meaning from the ciphertext unless you happen to know how the cipher works, and also a special input to the cipher known as the \"key\". The same cipher, with the same key, can be used to decrypt the ciphertext back into plaintext to make it readable again._\n",
    "\n",
    "The One Time Pad (OTP) is a very simple cipher where the cleartext is bitwise XORed with the key to form the ciphertext. When the same key is used to decrypt the ciphertext, we get back the plaintext. XOR is one of the most fundamental logic operations that takes as input two bits, and outputs one bit. The truth table is:\n",
