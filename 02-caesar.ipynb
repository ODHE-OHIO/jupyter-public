    "# The Caesar Cipher\n",
    "A cipher is a technique that can encrypt or decrypt data (which is commonly referred to as \"plaintext\" or \"cleartext\"). During encryption, the input plaintext is converted into what is known as the \"ciphertext\". It is impossible to read or extract any meaning from the ciphertext unless you happen to know how the cipher works, and also a special input to the cipher known as the \"key\". The same cipher, with the same key, can be used to decrypt the ciphertext back into plaintext to make it readable again.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will examine a very simple cipher known as the Caesar cipher. We have the notion of an \"alphabet\", which is the set of symbols that can be used to write down the plain and cipher texts. For example, the alphabet could consist of only lowercase letters in the English alphabet (26 symbols), upper and lowercase (52 symbols), or upper, lower and numbers (62 symbols). During encryption, each symbol in the plaintext will be replaced by another symbol in the same alphabet. The mapping between symbols thus forms the \"key\". While this key can be represented in binary, we shall not do so at this time to avoid confusion. Let's generate the key using Python, assume that the alphabet consists of lowercase letters only:"
